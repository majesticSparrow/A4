INFORMATION
path s to t is not safe if s has a camera
safe if no edges on path is a toll road
safe if no vertices except t contains a camera.

vertices.txt
    all specified vertices have red light cameras

edges.txt
some edges are toll roads with the last four letters of that line (excluding the newline character) being "TOLL"
    First two values in each row are the connecting vertices.
    Third value is the length of the edge.
    If a fourth value exists it is the string 'TOLL'


take_input -> 


take input vertex id v and value k
    closest k cameras from vertex v.
    shortest paths to each camera.
